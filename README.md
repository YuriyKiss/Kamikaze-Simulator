# Kamikaze Simulator Prototype

## Simple action game prototype built with Unity/C#

Main idea was to have a character with dynamites connected to his body with a button that explodes part of those dynamites cylinders. 
Explosions would destroy special objects like walls, affect barrels, crates etc. and kill enemies.
The main goal was to destroy walls, kill enemies and e.g. save girls trapped there.

Since idea was not looking promising, we've dumped it.

## Installation
Since I've had to remove all sensitive data (I mean all paid assets) from repository, 
you are not able to load the project without getting those required packages. 
However, I am leaving list below.
